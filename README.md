Regarding the Team Project for Android / IoT and Embedded Systems - University of Tsukuba

# Project Overview

Welcome to our new Android application project repository! This README provides the essential information we discussed after class. Let's keep this document updated as our project evolves.

## Important Dates

- **Final Report Deadline**: June 24, 18:00

## Project Organization

### Branches

We have established two branches to help organize our materials:
- `materials`: For all related documents and supportive materials.
- `stuff`: For miscellaneous items and exploratory work.

Feel free to add to these branches or suggest new ones!

### Collaboration

To facilitate our collaboration:
- We need to decide on the application's topic.
- Schedule a call when all team members are available to maximize productivity.

### Repository Guidelines

Please feel free to modify the repository as you see fit. If you make changes, add a brief description in the commit messages to help everyone understand your modifications.

### Responsibilities

We need to define and distribute tasks among team members. A separate file will be created to detail our responsibilities in a tabular format. This will include priority levels for tasks based on each member's preference and skill set.

#### Key Areas to Address

1. **Define Implementation Deadlines** (including personal deadlines).
2. **UX Design**: Design user interfaces and experiences.
3. **Server Setup on Raspberry Pi**: Configure and manage server operations.
4. **Server/Client Communication**: Develop the backend for server-client interactions.
5. **Application Algorithm**:
   - Research potential libraries.
   - Define necessary classes and possibly write custom libraries.
   - Outline object-oriented programming dependencies before implementation.
   - Implement the algorithm.
   - Develop tests to validate the algorithm before release.

### General Advice

- Stay healthy and maintain a positive team atmosphere.
- If you're unsure about something or facing difficulties, reach out to the team for support.

Let's keep the momentum going and create something great together!
